    STEP 1: LOOK THROUGH THE CLASS
    This class extends the MoveIntegralCommand class. Look through it and understand what is going
    on. Then Understand what is going on in the cpp file. With integrableSetpointSubsystem we are
    able to move the agitator by small amounts to accomplish shooting and unjamming. Since we need a
    way to switch between them we use a move_unjam_integral_comprised_command which switches between
    the two commands by scheduling them when necessary. Look through that command and understand how
    it works. Then go to launcher_control and implement the agitator.
