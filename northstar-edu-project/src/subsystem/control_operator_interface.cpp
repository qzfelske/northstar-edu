Chassis Task 4:
STEP 1: CREATE METHODS MADE IN THE HEADER FILE

This step is pretty straightforward. You need to define the methods you made in the header.

STEP 2: GET THE VALUES FROM THE REMOTE OBJECT

Make the methods return the values from the remote object directional channels.
We want to make these methods also use keyboard key inputs if they are available.

An example of directional chanel input is remote.getChannel(Remote::Channel::LEFT_VERTICAL)
An example of key input is remote.keyPressed(Remote::Key::S)
Take note that the values for key presses are 0 for not pressed and 1 for pressed. Vertical and
horizontal channels are percent output with 1.0f being 100% and -1.0f being 100% in the opposite
direction. For rotational output, the method needs to return a radians per second. A good way to
implement this is to multiply the output from the controller by a max speed

After you are done with this step, you should repeat task 3 and 4 for the fly sky remote
operator interface.
